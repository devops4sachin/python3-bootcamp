- Truthiness:

    x = 1
    x is 1  # True
    x is 0  # False

- We can call values that will resolve to True "truthy", or values that will resolve to False "falsy".

- Besides False conditional checks, other things that are naturally falsy include: empty objects, empty strings, None, and zero.


- Logical Operators:

and	: Truthy if both a AND b are true (logical conjunction)
    	if a and b:
            print(c)
or	: Truthy if either a OR b are true (logical disjunction)
    	if am_tired or is_bedtime:
            print("go to sleep")
not	: Truthy if the opposite of a is true (logical negation)	
        if not is_weekend:
            print("go to work")
